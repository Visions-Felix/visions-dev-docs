# Formatting Guide

Consistent code formatting is crucial for maintaining readability and reducing the cognitive load on developers. This guide outlines the formatting standards for our project, which are enforced using Prettier.

## Prettier Configuration

Our project uses Prettier for code formatting. Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures all code follows a consistent style. The configuration for Prettier is defined in the `.prettierrc` file at the root of the project.

## Formatting Before Committing

Before committing your code, ensure that Prettier has been executed and all files are formatted. This step is crucial to maintain code consistency across the project.

## Summary

- **Follow Prettier Configuration:** Ensure all code adheres to the formatting rules defined in the `.prettierrc` file.
- **Run Prettier Before Committing:** Always run Prettier to format your code before making a commit.
